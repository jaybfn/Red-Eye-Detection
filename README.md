# Red-Eye-Detection

### The goal of this project is to use computer vision techniques to detect instances of red eye in drivers who may be experiencing stress or fatigue. Red eye can be a sign of stress or fatigue, and it can potentially impair a driver's ability to operate a vehicle safely. By detecting and alerting drivers to the presence of red eye, we can help them to take steps to reduce their stress and fatigue, and improve their overall safety on the road. To accomplish this, we will use a variety of computer vision algorithms to analyze images of drivers' eyes and identify instances of red eye. We will then develop an alert system that can notify drivers when red eye is detected, and provide them with recommendations for reducing stress and fatigue. This project has the potential to improve road safety and reduce the number of accidents caused by stressed or fatigued drivers.
